The visual part of the game is done by Turtle. Each circle, peg and message are connected to a turtle instance. So we use
each individual turtle to draw them rather than use a public turtle.When user selects the color and press the check button,
the color will be compared to the answer and the pegs will display the result.

After the game finish, if the users fails, nothing will be recorded. If user success, his/her current score will be compared to his/her
previous best score and the updated score will be written into a leaderboard file.
